          This is a very <strong>strong</strong> text, because it is
          <strong>bold</strong>.<br /><br />
          I am brushing up on my HTML and CSS, although i have been learning
          from a very young age, there is always some things that are missed
          when self taught anything!

        <h2>What is My Intent</h2>
        <p>
          Currently in this project, i will not be focusing my energy on any of
          the SEO i know, but the basic bread and butter of html and css.<br /><br />
          Once i have a clear understanding i will move swiftly onto advanced
          css, flex-boxes and i am so excited to add sass to my arsenal!
